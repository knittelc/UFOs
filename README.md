### Improvements and Limitations

- Some of the drawbacks of this type of filters, are that the user would need to actually know what the options are already by scrolling all the way through the data, thus negating the usefulness of a filter.  A better idea would be a predictive or filter in filter use.  So, if the user were to type a 'C' for the state options only the 'c' options would present themselves.  The "shape" category could use a little help.  Not many people would know to look for 'round' vs 'circle', and 'light' is not a shape inherently known for usage in this instance.
- This data set is also very limited and all the dates are the same.  A larger study of global ufo spottings would lend itself to more credibility.
